-Used to exchange cryptographic keys securely bettween parties 
Deffie-Hellman key exchange
-which allows two parties to agree on a shared secret key without any prior communication or shared private information
-classic finite-field DH is generally heavier than elliptic-curve DH (ECDH) at comparable security levels, which can affect low-power or latency-sensitive devices

Elliptic curve DH (ECDH)
-uses elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to generate the shared secret key

Rivest-Shamir-Aldeman (RSA)
- uses the properties of large prime numbers to generate a shared secret key

Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
-uses elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to generate digital signatures that can authenticate the parties involved in the key exchange.
